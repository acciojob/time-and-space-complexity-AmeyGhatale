	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational time it takes to run an algorithm. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is when scaling to larger input sizes. The more efficient an algorithm, the better it handles larger data sets without significantly increasing the time it takes to execute.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity with bold text -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory space an algorithm requires relative to its input size. It is important to consider both time and memory usage when evaluating algorithms. For instance, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) scales linearly with the input size, meaning the memory usage increases proportionally to the input.</p>
